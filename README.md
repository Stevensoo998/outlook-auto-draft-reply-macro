## ‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility Note

This macro is designed to work with a specific **WooCommerce email template** layout (commonly used in `customer-completed-order` or `new order` notifications).

If you are using a **customized** or third-party WooCommerce email template:
- The macro **may fail to detect** or parse product rows correctly
- Table structure or tags (like `<td>`, `<tr>`, etc.) might differ
- Additional adjustments to the `GetProductTableRows` or `ExtractCell` functions may be required

> üí° Always test with your live store‚Äôs actual email template before deployment.
